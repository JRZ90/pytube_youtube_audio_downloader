## youtube audio downloader 
This is a Python program that uses the pytube and moviepy libraries to download and convert audio from a youtube video and save it in mp3 format. This program was designed to download audio from a series of lectures and listen to it as a podcast with the prior approval of its authors. I am not responsible for any other use of this piece of software.
